 * @brief File declaring an abstraction layer for the IRC protocol.
 *
 * This code declares a bunch of useful functions to make handling
 * the IRC protocol much easier on the programmer.  This will not
 * likely be used much because there will be one more abstraction layer
 * for implementing modules to communicate with this application.
 *
 * It also declares some IRC variables for identification, etc.
